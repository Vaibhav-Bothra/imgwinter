    <h1 style="color: rgb(245,157,7);"> Quizzer</h1>
    <div>is an initiative taken by the three of us who are currently studying in IIT-R ,ECE, 1st year.We were
      deeply interested in web development and thus tried our best to gain as much as knowledge as we can from different
      sources.We all are pretty comfortable in using HTML,CSS,Javascript,Mongodb as well as node.js.In order to
      challenge
      our skills we decided to make a website.We realised that there is an absence of a quiz website which had the
      features required by us
      .Hence we decided to add the as many neccessary features as we can.The features that we wanted to included
      students to
      prepare for specific topics with the help of self-quiz facility,users to add questions in our database that can be
      used by
      any other user,which helps to make a great community.We wanted multiple students to compete with each other ,both
      as individual
      users and as group-mates.We have tried to achive most of these features and will be working ahead to add more so
      as to enhance
      user experience.
